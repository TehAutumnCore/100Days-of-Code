https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

This is a 100 days of Code challenge to improve my own skills with python as well 
as some other technologies.
This course will teach me the following:

Automation,game, app and web development, data science, and machine learning using python
Selenium, Beautiful Soup, Request, Flask, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit,Learn, Plotly, Matplotib
Python for data science and machine learning
Building GUIs and desktop applications with python

I am going to complete this course without looking up anything besides what is provided
through the course already. Pledging to myself that I will create everything from the top
of my mind, and will go back to update and make the projects more efficient down the line. 
The goal is to become a python developer. Whether it is back-end, or machine learning or
even ai.
